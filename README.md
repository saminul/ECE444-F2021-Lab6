## Pros and Cons of TDD


### Pros

In TDD, since we write the tests first and then write code to satisfy that test, we end up writng only code that is needed reducing redundancies.  And since we focus on one test at a time, the code becomes more modular and easier to maintain. This also leads to easier refactoring down the line. TDD also means that there will be a high amount of test coverage leading to less errors and easier debugging. Writing all these tests results in an easier time when writing documentation for a project as the developer already has a good idea of how the project should be used.


### Cons


One of biggest disadvantages to TDD is that it requires additional time and effort which otherwise could have been focused on programming so this might not be suited for fast grwoing projects (like startups). It is also something the entire team has to agree to which might be an issue. TDD requires the tests themselves to be maintained and updated as the features are which could get redundant and take up extra time. TDD does not necessarily removes bugs aswell, we can only check for the bugs which we think might occur so if a developer does not understand the feature fully, they might not write good quality tests to test the fearture.
